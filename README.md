Welcome to memeparser! Below is a list of python modules you need to install before you can run main.py:

* praw (sudo pip install praw)

* time

* os

* pygame (sudo pip install pygame)

* wget (sudo pip install wget)

Of course, you will need to have python 3.x installed with pip, preferrably where both python and pip are in your $PATH.

FEATURES I WANT IN THIS SOFTWARE MOVING FORWARD:

* ability to choose download directory

* automatic proxying

* *downloading from sites other than reddit*

* *analytics collected, sent to remote database to be aggregated and displayed on a public/private website (tbd)*
